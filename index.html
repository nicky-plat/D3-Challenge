          <h2>Poverty and the Uninsured, Smoking and Obesity:</h2>
          <p>dults in low-income households appear to be more likely to be uninsured than people in higher income households, 
            but not all uninsured adults are in families with low incomes. Texas has the highest number of uninsured adults, 
            but does not have the highest number of families in poverty.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., people living below the poverty level have higher rates of cigarette smoking than the general population. Poverty, however, does not appear to be the only factor
            that contributes a likelihood of cigarette smoking. California and New York fall around the median in terms of poverty rates, but 
            have some of the lowest rates of smoking relative to their populations.</p>
          <p>Poverty-dense areas often have diminished access to fresh food. However, there are states, such as New Hampshire, that have very low poverty rates but still have relatively
            higher rates of obesity.</p>

          <h2>Age and the Uninsured, Smoking and Obesity:</h2>
          <p>Young adults are the most likely to go without coverage. Massachusetts appears to have the lowest number of uninsured individuals, while Texas has the highest rate, and a much lower median age.
            Florida has a higher median age than other states at 42, but has much higher rates of poverty, which could be a contributer to its higher uninsured population.</p>
          <p>States with larger populations of older age groups tend to have the highest rates of smoking. as opposed to a state like Utah, where the median age is very low and much of the population doesn't smoke at all.</p>
          <p>There does appear to be slight correlation between a states median age and level of obesity. It appears that higher age groups are more succeptible to being obese, but that is not always the case.</p>

          <h2>Income and the Uninsured, Smoking and Obesity:</h2>
          <p>Household income contributes directly to the level of poverty. Most uninsured people are in low-income households.</p>
          <p>States with lower median household income tend to have higher rates of smoking. States with higher median incomes have lower rates of smoking.</p>
          <p>Overall obesity prevalence tends to decrease with increased levels of income. Just as poverty affects the availability of healthy food options, so does income.</p>
